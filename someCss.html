<h1>Hi, my name is Emily Phan. I am passionate about puppies, Disneyland, and Jesus. To be completely honest, I'm horrible when it comes to working with technology. I barely know how to turn on my TV at home. Excel is beyond me. </h1>
<p>In my free time I enjoy napping and eating. I am intending to major in Biology and go down the Premed track and become a Dermatologist. </p>
